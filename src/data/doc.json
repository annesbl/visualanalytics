Let‚Äôs dig into the story of one of these artifacts."},{"text":"The Lenna image may be relatively unknown in pop culture today, but in the engineering world, it remains an icon. I first encountered the image in an undergrad class, then grad school, and then all over the sites and software I use every day as a tech worker like <a href=https://github.com/mikolalysenko/lena target=_blank>Github</a>, <a href=https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.3/dc/dd3/tutorial_gausian_median_blur_bilateral_filter.html target=_blank>OpenCV</a>, <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56346850/set-image-inside-png-transparency target=_blank>Stack Overflow</a>, and <a href=https://www.quora.com/topic/Image-Processing target=_blank>Quora</a>."},{"text":"This is Lenna. </br> </br> To understand where she is today, you have to understand how she got here."},{"text":"Lenna was <a href=https://www.iplayboy.com/issue/19721101 target=_blank>first published in Playboy</a> in <span>1972</span>. Soon after, USC engineers searching for a suitable test image for their research sought inspiration from a Playbook magazine. They deemed Lenna the right fit and scanned the image into RGB existence. From here, the story of the image follows the story of the Internet. Lenna was one of the first inhabitants of ARPANet, the Internet‚Äôs predecessor, and then the world wide web.","image":"playboy"},{"text":"While the image‚Äôs reach was limited to a few research papers in the 70s and 80s, in <span>1991</span>, Lenna was featured on the cover of an <a href=https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/optical-engineering/volume-30/issue-07 target=_blank>engineering journal</a> alongside another popular test image, <a href=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Original-standard-test-image-of-Peppers_fig8_259521525 target=_blank>Peppers</a>.","image":"journal"},{"text":"This caught the attention of Playboy, which threatened a copyright infringement lawsuit. Engineers who had grown attached to Lenna fought back. Ultimately, they prevailed, and as a Playboy VP <a href=https://www.wired.com/1997/05/playmate-meets-geeks-who-made-her-a-net-star/ target=_blank>reflected on the drama</a>: \"We decided we should exploit this because it is a phenomenon.\""},{"text":"The Playboy controversy canonized Lenna in engineering folklore and prompted an explosion of the image‚Äôs presence on the Internet, rising to a peak number of instances in <span>1995</span>."},{"text":"In the 21st century, the image has remained a common sight in classrooms and on TV, including a feature on <a href=https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley target=_blank>Silicon Valley</a> in <span>2014</span>.","image":"silicon-valley"},{"text":"Pushback towards the use of the image also grew in the 2010s leading up to <span>2019</span>, when the <a href=https://www.losinglena.com/ target=_blank>Losing Lena</a> documentary was released. In this film, Lena Fors√©n, the real human behind the Lenna image, shares her side of the story and asks for her image to be retired. The film calls on the engineering community to stop their spread of the image and use alternatives instead. In the process, it also sparked increasing attention to the female engineer experience. This led to efforts to remove the image from production code and a slow, but noticeable decline in the image‚Äôs use in research.","image":"losing-lena"},{"text":"But despite this progress, the use of Lenna continues today. The image appears on the Internet in 30+ different languages in the last decade, including 10+ languages in <span>2021</span>."},{"text":"The image‚Äôs spread across digital geographies has mirrored this geographical growth, moving from mostly <span class=org-span>.org</span> domains before 1990 to over 100 different domains today, notably <span class=com-span>.com</span> and <span class=edu-span>.edu</span>, along with <span class=other-span>others</span>."},{"text":"Within the <span class=edu-span>.edu</span> world, the Lenna image continues to appear in <a href=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~stiff.4/cse3521/image-convolutions-transformations.html target=_blank>homework questions</a>, <a href=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1109/2013su/lecs/lec11.pdf target=_blank>class slides</a>, and <a href=https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/png/png.html target=_blank>educational and research databases</a>, ensuring that it is passed down to new generations of engineers. Whether it's due to institutional negligence or defiance, it seems that for now, the image is here to stay."}],"postProse":[{"type":"text","value":"Having known Lenna for almost a decade, I have struggled to understand what the story of the image means for what tech culture is and what it is becoming. Many of my female colleagues have personal stories to share about their encounters with the image throughout their careers. When one of the only women this well referenced, respected, and remembered in your field is known for a nude photo that was taken of her and is now used without her consent, it inevitably shapes the perception of the position of women in tech and the value of our contributions."},{"type":"text","value":"To me, the crux of the Lenna story is how little power we have over our data and how it is used and abused.
